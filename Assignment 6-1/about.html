      <h2>Let me tell you about this website...</h2>
      <p>
        This website was built to show everyone about my favorite websites. In
        this website, you will see all the websites I visit on a daily basis to
        help me with school, coding, or just plain entertainment. I am an avid
        jiu-jitsu practitioner, and I spend most of my free time studying
        matches. I find myself on youtube a lot searching for new moves, and
        escapes I can add in my game.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also a lot of websites in my list that helps me with coding.
        From tutorials to references, and also youtube videos of people in the
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might find that some websites I visit can be some of the websites
        you visit on a daily basis as well!
